# modernseinfeld_bot


Setup:
- This notebook probably won't work as-is on Colab, due to file IO. My local dev environment was jupyter notebook with a miniconda 4.11.0 python environment, run on a macbook
- You'll need an OpenAI API key. Save this either to your Google drive in ./data/GPT3_api.key or in an .env file in the working directory
- The data is saved in ./data. You can use the ScrapeTwitter_ModernSeinfeld notebook to see how the tweets were gathered.
